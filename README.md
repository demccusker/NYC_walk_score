# NYC_walk_score
This project investigates the relationships between walkability scores, population, low/middle income population, households, housing units, and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) eligibility in New York City. The first part shows off my data wrangling and cleaning skills. The next two parts show my skills in data visualization for exploratory and explanatory purposes. 
The questions I wanted to answer: 
1. Do census tracts that are grant eligible have better walk scores?
2. Are blocks with larger household sizes more walkable?
3. Are lower income people living in less or more walkable places than higher income people?
4. How does the borough impact household size, walk score, and percent lower income?

The answers to the first three questions were, somewhat disappointingly, no; there were no substantial differences. However, borough did have a substantial impact on each of those other variables! Here are some of my key findings:
1. The median block in NYC has a walk score of 14, and the distribution of walk scores are approximately normal.
2. The median household in NYC has between 2.75 and 3.0 people living in it.
3. The Bronx has the highest percentage of low and moderate income residents; Staten Island and Manhattan have the least
4. Queens has the largest households, with an average of more than 3 people per household, while Manhattan only has about 2 people per household on average.

For more specifics of what I found and how I came to these conclusions, please check out the rest of the project!
